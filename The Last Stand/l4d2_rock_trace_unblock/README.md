# [L4D2 Only] Rock Trace Unblock

### Introduction
- Solely handles the rock radius checks to prevent blocking by hunter/jockey that is dominating survivors.
- Additionally allow to force jockey dismount the survivor who eats rock.
- This plugin takes over game function `ForEachPlayer<ProximityCheck>`.
	- It really seems like the game traces refuse to believe results from detoured `PassServerEntityFilter`, which is why I have to rework the whole logic.
	- And therefore it conflicts with [l4d_checkpoint_rock_patch](https://github.com/Target5150/MoYu_Server_Stupid_Plugins/tree/master/The%20Last%20Stand/l4d_checkpoint_rock_patch) whose functionalities are included here.
