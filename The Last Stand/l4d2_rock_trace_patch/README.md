# [L4D2 Only] Rock Trace Patch

### Introduction
- Patches to change the trace filter used in rock radius check.
	- Defaults to `CTraceFilterSimpleList`, detoured to `CTraceFilterSimpleNoInfectedTeamOrGhosts`.
- Basically the same functionality but less flexibility of [l4d2_rock_trace_unblock](https://github.com/Target5150/MoYu_Server_Stupid_Plugins/tree/master/The%20Last%20Stand/l4d2_rock_trace_unblock)
- This plugin doesn't conflict with [l4d_checkpoint_rock_patch](https://github.com/Target5150/MoYu_Server_Stupid_Plugins/tree/master/The%20Last%20Stand/l4d_checkpoint_rock_patch).
