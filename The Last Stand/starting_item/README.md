### Introduction
- Forked from [Competitive Rework](https://github.com/SirPlease/L4D2-Competitive-Rework), credit to original authors.
- `starting_item_list` instead, configured with a list of weapon names instead of a flag.
> NOTE: Generally supported melees are limited, unsupported ones won't spawned. A list of them can be found in "missions.txt".
