# [L4D & 2] Fix Fix Nextbot Collision

### Introduction
- Reduce the possibility that commons jiggle around when close to each other.
	- A well-known issue happens when setting `nb_update_frequency` to low value.
	- Note that this one doesn't perfectly fix the issue. Need more efforts into how the game resolves collisions.
