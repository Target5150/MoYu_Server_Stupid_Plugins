# [L4D2] Fix Changelevel

### Introduction
- Fix issues due to forced changelevel.
	- i.e. No gascans in scavenge, incorrect behavior of **OnGameplayStart**.
- An automatic version of [LuxLuma's "l4d2_changelevel"](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=2669850), means that you don't have to replace every **changelevel** with the native.
