			 * After the last update, all offsets in the class 'CTerrorPlayer' changed to offset - 32,
			 * which proves that we found it right (old offset 15988 -32 = 15956)
			 *
			 * How can find this:
			 * function 'CTerrorPlayer::OnPummelEnded' the very end:
			 *
			 *        v37 = *((_DWORD *)this + 3757);
			 *        *((_DWORD *)this + 3989) = -1; 									//we need to find this line 3989. 3989*4=15956
			 *        result = (*(int (__fastcall **)(void *))(v37 + 248))(v35);
			 *        if ( !*((_BYTE *)this + 14833) )
			 *          result = CTerrorPlayer::WarpToValidPositionIfStuck();
			 *
			 * How to find it on windows: 
			 * We need to find the string "charger_pummel_end",
			 * this will point to a function 'CTerrorPlayer::OnPummelEnded' in windows.
			 * function 'CTerrorPlayer::OnPummelEnded' the very end:
			 *
			 *        v3[3994] = -1;													//we need to find this line 3994. 3994*4=15976
			 *        (*(void (**)(void))(v3[3762] + 244))();
			 *        sub_102FB440(v3);
			 *
			 *        //sub_102FB440 this is a function WarpToValidPositionIfStuck(), click on it there should be a line at the end
			 *        //DevMsg("unsticking %s from %.1f %.1f %.1f to %.1f %.1f %.1f\n", v5); 
			 *        //if it is, then you have found the right place
